        <h3> Breakfastime</h3>
        <img src="./images/breakfast.jpg" width="566" height="494" alt="Breakfast">
            <figcaption>Here we have a breakfast from a particularly snowy day in the almost forgotten Winter of 2019. <br>
            The secret to this perfectly crisp bacon?<br>
            Bake it in the oven. No burn injuries, no oil stains, and no smelly kitchen. <br>
            Throw in a little coffee and science, and you've got yourself a delightful morning.</figcaption>

        <img src= "./images/cookies.jpg" alt = "cookies" height="864" width="576">
        <figcaption>Maybe these look like run of the mill, boring old chocolate chip cookies. <br>
           Don't be fooled. <br>
           These little treasures are made with cardamom and orange zest.<br>
           They're warm, zesty, buttery, and chocolately. Can't go wrong with all of that.</figcaption>

        <h3>Buffalo Chicken Meatballtime</h3>
        <img src = "./images/bufchxmeatballs.jpg" alt= "Buffalo Chicken Meatballs" height="566" width="545">
        <figcaption>You know and love buffalo chicken wings. But let me pose this query:<br>
            What if everything was mashed up into one meatball?<br>
           I'll tell you what...it's an adventure for the taste buds.<br>
           These have ground chicken, ranch, celery leaves, breadcrumbs, all rolled around in a buttery wing sauce.<br>
           Want to be popular at a party? Bring these. They were a heck of a crowd-pleaser.</figcaption>
